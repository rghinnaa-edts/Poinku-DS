# Skeleton
`Skeleton` loading (also called skeleton screens) is a technique used in iOS development to show a placeholder UI while the actual content is loading. Instead of showing a traditional loading spinner, it displays a simplified version of the UI that mimics the final layout using animated placeholder shapes.

## Installation
To use the `Skeleton` component, please add a view for skeleton above the other view, and add class of Skeleton.swift inside the View/Skeleton file.

For further customization or to extend this component, you can ask UX Engineer or Inherit the `Skeleton` and override its methods or add additional functionality as required.
